     Alan Mathison Turing (June 1912- June 1954), an English mathematician and logician, is widely regarded as one of the greatest cryptanalysts (codebreakers) history has ever seen. <br><br>
     He also holds the honor of being the father of theoretical computer science and modern AI, through his groundbreaking concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" target="_blank">the Turing Machine</a>, which formalised the concepts of "algorithm" and "computation", the cornerstones of theoretical computer science.<br><br>
     But perhaps the single most important reason Turing is and will be remembered is his breaking of the Nazi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine" target="_blank">Enigma cipher</a>, that ended the second world war significantly sooner, saving millions of lives and resources.

    Here's a Timeline of just a few of Turing's great achievements:<br><br>
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>1934 - </b>graduates with first class honors in mathematics from King's College, Cambridge</li>
      <li><b>1935 - </b>elected fellow at King's for a dissertation proving the Central Limit Theorem</li>
      <li><b>1940 - </b>the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe" target="_blank">bombe</a> machine (capable of breaking codes generated by the Enigna) is installed</li>
      <li><b>1946 - </b>publishes a paper with a detailed design of the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored-program_computer" target="_blank">stored program computer</a></li>
      <li><b>1949 - </b>devised an experiment to test the "intelligence" of computers, known as the Turing Test in his honor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Despite his huge services to his country, his role in bringing global peace and his contributions to mathematics and technology, Turing was accused of public indecency in 1952 for being in a homosexual relationship with a consenting adult, and was put on libido inhibiting medication.
 
      Turing finally committed suicide on 8th June 1954 in his house by ingesting cyanide.

      There is also a movie named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game" target="_blank">The Imitation Game</a> going into the life and achievements of this genius.
